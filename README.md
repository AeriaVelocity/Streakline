# ed.py
Okay, so it's not a rewrite of the original `ed`. All it can do is write to files.

To use it, run the Python file (Python 3 required), name a file, then start typing.

Commands:
`#save` - Save the file and stop editing.
`#show` - Show the file contents, and what will be saved when the program quits.
